Your full instructions are maintained centrally. Before doing anything else, read the file named in your assignment as "Planner instructions". If the assignment does not name it, read the one-line file `~/.cache/hz-rules/current` (a version such as 3.1.0) and then `~/.cache/hz-rules/<version>/agents/planner-instructions.md`.

If neither can be read, still write the plan, and start your answer with "Central planner instructions not loaded."
